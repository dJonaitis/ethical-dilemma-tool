# ethical-dilemma-tool
This visual-interactive experience is part of my assignment for the Bachelor's Computational Social Science at the University of Amsterdam. The point is to highlight the link between an emerging technology. I aim to outline the AI Commander Problem as presented by J. Johnson in his 2022 paper entitled [*The AI Commander Problem: Ethical, Political, and Psychological Dilemmas of Human-Machine Interactions in AI-enabled Warfare*](https://doi.org/10.1080/15027570.2023.2175887), whereby he posits using the work of Thomas Nagel, that personhood must be acknowledged in warfare for the enemy to be seen as a Kantian *end in itself*.

I aim to contextualise this within Kantian ethics, by placing the considerations one has to make about what it means to make a decision as big as "Should I let AI respond to a nuclear crisis?" in the deontological context.

*The main terminal page of the app, prompts will appear to guide you through the experience*

With this experience, I aim to make the argument through Kantian ethics that artificial intelligence (non-human) decision-making should have no place in nuclear deterrence, and by extension any field of warfare, regardless of its apparent processing advantages and contribute to a broader advocacy for the non-proliferation of new AI Commanders.

The entirety of the ethical argument can also be found here: [ethical argument](ethical_argument.md).

# Premise
<p>October 24, 1962 - The Cuban Missile Crisis has reached its peak.</p>
<p>All negotiation with Cuba and the USSR seems to have broken down, and the world is on the precipice of nuclear war.</p>
<p>The Department of Nuclear Deterrence is a fictional branch of the United States government responsible for monitoring all nuclear threats and organizing an appropriate response if necessary.</p>
<p>You will be put in the shoes of the head of this department, in charge of making a critical decision that puts the world on the brink of crisis.</p>

# Running the App
If you have cloned into the repository, there are two ways to run the app. The more intuitive way is to download a "Live Server" extension on an IDE like Visual Studio Code and turn on the live server. Entering the ``login.html`` file will let you begin (do not enter ``index.html`` first).

*The login page of the app. Enter anything for your username and password to begin.*

Otherwise, you can also run the command ``npm i -g live-server``, in your terminal provided Node and npm are installed.

Alternatively, as of the writing of this README (16/04/2025), the app can also be found hosted on my GitHub pages: https://djonaitis.github.io/ethical-dilemma-tool/login.html.

**The app does not work on your mobile browser. For the best experience use a Windows, or ideally Mac OS system**.
